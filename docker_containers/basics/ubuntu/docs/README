# FROM: 
compulsory, it provides the starting image we will use to build our customised one;

# RUN: 
this is the most used instruction, that alllows to run most shell commands during the build. Multiple RUN instructions are often found in a single Dockerfile;

# VOLUME: 
creates a mount point ready to be used for mounting external (e.g. host) volumes; creates the corresponding directory if not existing;

# WORKDIR: 
changes directory to the specified path; the last current directory in the build will be the working directory in the running container.

Note: if you use instead RUN cd <..>, the changed directory will only persist within that RUN instruction, and then be lost in subsequent build steps;

# CMD: 
specifies the default command to be executed with the container. bash is the default anyway for Ubuntu containers, but itâ€™s good to be aware of this syntax.

docker build -t cautree/ubuntu .
docker tag cautree/ubuntu cautree/ubuntu
